This contains an extension to the robot class at https://github.com/systemetric/robot in the **terminator** class

As of now we have movement options in the 4 basic async functions

*move(meters),*

*turn(angles),*

*goto(marker),*

*snap(x, y)*

Additionally an extension of robot.see() in the form of the combined *triangulate* and *peak* methods
